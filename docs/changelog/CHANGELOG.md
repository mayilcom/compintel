## [0.1.11] 2026-04-15 — NinjaPear competitor enrichment (background, cached)

### Added

**Database**
- `supabase/migrations/006_ninjapear_cache.sql` — adds `ninjapear_cache` table (website-keyed, 30-day TTL, shared across accounts), `competitor_suggestions` table (per-account suggestions with pending/accepted/dismissed status), and `accounts.ninjapear_enrichment_status` column.

**Workers**
- `apps/workers/src/workers/enrichment.ts` — new Railway cron worker (daily 8am IST). Picks up accounts with `ninjapear_enrichment_status = 'pending'`, checks `ninjapear_cache` before calling NinjaPear `/competitor/listing`, stores new competitors as `competitor_suggestions`, marks account `done`. Skips brands already tracked. Gracefully handles API timeout (100s) and missing key.

**API routes**
- `src/app/api/suggestions/[id]/route.ts` — `PATCH { action: 'accept' | 'dismiss' }`. Accept: inserts competitor brand row from suggestion + marks accepted. Dismiss: marks dismissed only. Ownership-checked via `account_id`.

**Components**
- `src/components/dashboard/competitor-suggestions.tsx` — `'use client'` card shown on dashboard when pending suggestions exist. Add / Dismiss per item, Add all button. Removes item from list optimistically after action.

### Updated

- `src/app/app/dashboard/page.tsx` — queries `competitor_suggestions` for the account and renders `<CompetitorSuggestions>` above the competitor table when suggestions are pending.
- `src/app/api/onboarding/complete/route.ts` — sets `ninjapear_enrichment_status = 'pending'` alongside `onboarding_completed_at`, triggering the enrichment worker on its next daily run.
- `apps/workers/package.json` — added `"enrichment": "tsx src/workers/enrichment.ts"` script.
- `apps/workers/railway.toml` — added enrichment service entry (cron `30 2 * * *` UTC = 8am IST daily, requires `NINJAPEAR_API_KEY`).
- `.env.local.example` — added `NINJAPEAR_API_KEY`.

### Cache strategy

NinjaPear competitor listing costs ~74 credits and takes ~82 seconds per company. Results are cached in `ninjapear_cache` for 30 days keyed by website URL, shared across all accounts that track the same competitor. After the initial call, subsequent accounts with the same competitor domain pay 0 credits and get instant results.

## [0.1.10] 2026-04-15 — Force dynamic rendering on all data-fetching pages

### Fixed

Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to all 9 server component pages that query Supabase or Clerk at request time. Without this, Next.js attempts to prerender them at build time — failing because env vars (Supabase URL/key, Clerk key) are runtime secrets not available during the Vercel build phase.

Pages fixed: `admin/accounts`, `admin/lookup`, `app/briefs`, `app/briefs/[brief_id]`, `app/dashboard`, `app/settings/channels`, `app/settings/subscription`, `app/settings/team`, `brief/[brief_id]`.

---

## [0.1.9] 2026-04-14 — Build fixes (TypeScript + Turbopack errors)

### Fixed

- `src/app/api/settings/team/route.ts` — operator precedence error: `|| ... ??` mix requires parens around the `||` operand before applying `??`.
- `src/app/app/settings/team/page.tsx` — same operator precedence fix (identical pattern).
- `src/app/api/settings/subscription/route.ts` — Supabase `GenericStringError` type not directly castable to account shape; cast through `unknown` first.
- `src/app/app/settings/subscription/page.tsx` — same `as unknown as` cast fix.
- `src/app/app/briefs/page.tsx` — `brief.sent_at` typed `unknown` (from `Record<string, unknown>` row); changed `&&` short-circuit to ternary `? ... : null` so TypeScript accepts it as `ReactNode`.

---

## [0.1.8] 2026-04-14 — Single-domain deployment (emayil.com)

### Changed

- Deployment URL consolidated to `emayil.com` (was `app.emayil.com`). The subdomain added complexity with no user-facing benefit since the landing page and app are a single Next.js deployment.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` default fallback updated in `src/app/layout.tsx`, `src/app/brief/[brief_id]/page.tsx`, and `apps/workers/src/workers/brief-assembler.ts`.
- `.env.local.example` updated to reflect `https://emayil.com`.
- All documentation updated: `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/README.md`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/architecture/overview.md`.

### Action required on deploy

- Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://emayil.com` in Vercel environment variables.
- Update Clerk Dashboard redirect URLs from `app.emayil.com/*` to `emayil.com/*`.
- Update Razorpay, Stripe, and Clerk webhook URLs to `emayil.com/api/webhooks/*`.

## [0.1.7] 2026-04-14 — Settings pages wired, onboarding complete, upgrade checkout, team management

### Added

**Database**
- `supabase/migrations/005_account_profile_fields.sql` — adds `company_name text` and `role text` to accounts table; used by the settings profile page.

**API routes**
- `src/app/api/settings/profile/route.ts` — `GET` (Clerk display name + account fields) + `PATCH` (updates `company_name`, `role`, `whatsapp_number` on accounts).
- `src/app/api/settings/recipients/route.ts` — `GET` (list active recipients + plan limit) + `POST` (create, enforces plan limit, returns 403 with `upgrade: true` when at limit).
- `src/app/api/settings/recipients/[id]/route.ts` — `DELETE` (soft-delete via `active = false`, ownership-checked).
- `src/app/api/settings/delivery/route.ts` — `GET` (delivery state + computed next Sunday IST label) + `POST` (`action: skip | pause | resume` toggles `skip_next_delivery` / `delivery_paused` on accounts).
- `src/app/api/settings/subscription/route.ts` — `GET` returns plan, subscription_status, billing_currency, trial_ends_at, gateway, and live usage counts (brands / competitors / recipients) from Supabase.
- `src/app/api/settings/team/route.ts` — `GET` returns Clerk org members (falls back to owner-only when no org); `POST` sends a Clerk org invitation, creating the org first if `clerk_org_id` is null on the account.
- `src/app/api/onboarding/complete/route.ts` — `POST` stamps `onboarding_completed_at` on the account (no-op if already set).

**Components**
- `src/components/settings/team-invite-form.tsx` — `'use client'` invite card; shows seat-limit upgrade prompt when at cap, otherwise POSTs to `/api/settings/team` and shows inline success/error state.
- `src/components/upgrade/plan-cards.tsx` — `'use client'` card grid handling both gateway flows: Stripe (JSON `url` → `window.location.href`) and Razorpay (opens checkout modal via dynamically loaded `razorpay.js`).

### Updated

**Pages — Onboarding**
- `src/app/onboarding/recipients/page.tsx` — converted to `'use client'`; add form POSTs to `/api/settings/recipients`; added list shows confirmed recipients; Continue skips the API call if none added.
- `src/app/onboarding/done/page.tsx` — converted to `'use client'`; fires `POST /api/onboarding/complete` on mount via `useEffect`.

**Pages — Settings**
- `src/app/app/settings/profile/page.tsx` — `'use client'`; loads from `GET /api/settings/profile` on mount; name/email are read-only (Clerk-managed); company, role, and phone save via `PATCH`; inline "Saved" confirmation.
- `src/app/app/settings/delivery/page.tsx` — `'use client'`; loads delivery state from `GET /api/settings/delivery`; Skip / Pause / Resume buttons call `POST /api/settings/delivery`; state updates optimistically.
- `src/app/app/settings/recipients/page.tsx` — replaced MOCK data with `GET /api/settings/recipients`; add form and Remove buttons call the new routes; upgrade modal fires when at plan limit.
- `src/app/app/settings/subscription/page.tsx` — server component; reads plan + usage counts directly from Supabase; usage bars colour-coded (gold / watch / threat); billing history section shows gateway-specific contact note or trial message.
- `src/app/app/settings/team/page.tsx` — server component; reads Clerk org members via `clerkClient()` (falls back to owner); passes seat limit + current count to `<TeamInviteForm>`.
- `src/app/app/settings/channels/page.tsx` — server component; reads `accounts.oauth_tokens` to derive real connected / disconnected / auto status per channel; Connect buttons disabled with note pending OAuth rollout; plan-tier locking driven by `PLAN_LIMITS`.
- `src/app/upgrade/page.tsx` — refactored to server component (reads `searchParams`, avoids `useSearchParams` SSR issue); delegates rendering to `<UpgradePlanCards>`.

**API**
- `src/app/api/checkout/route.ts` — Stripe flow now returns `{ gateway: 'stripe', url }` JSON instead of `NextResponse.redirect()`; consistent with Razorpay response shape so the client can handle both uniformly.

## [0.1.6] 2026-04-14 — App briefs pages, onboarding wired to API, signal card shared component

### Added

**Components**
- `src/components/brief/signal-card.tsx` — shared `<SignalCard>` component and `SignalCardData` interface. Type-coloured left-border card with signal type badge, channel label, headline, body, optional implication box, and source links. Used by both public `/brief/[id]` and authenticated `/app/briefs/[id]`.

**Pages**
- `src/app/app/briefs/page.tsx` — authenticated briefs list. Fetches all briefs for the account in reverse issue order; batches all signal IDs into one query to get signal types; renders signal-type dot indicators, held/preview-ready badges, read/unread badge, and delivery date.
- `src/app/app/briefs/[brief_id]/page.tsx` — authenticated brief detail. Verifies account ownership; shows preview banner for `assembled` status, held/failed warning banners; share button only visible when `status = 'sent'`; renders signals via `<SignalCard>`.

**API routes**
- `src/app/api/onboarding/brand/route.ts` — `POST` saves (or updates) the client brand and sets `accounts.category` + `accounts.market`. Maps UI category labels to DB values; upserts the single `is_client = true` brand row.
- `src/app/api/onboarding/competitors/search/route.ts` — `GET ?q=` fuzzy brand search. Short queries use ilike; longer queries call `find_similar_brand` Postgres RPC (threshold 0.25); falls back to ilike if RPC is unavailable.
- `src/app/api/onboarding/competitors/save/route.ts` — `POST { competitors }` inserts confirmed competitor brands, skipping duplicates by name. Stores `channels.instagram.handle` and `channels.amazon.brand_name` from lookup data. Returns `{ inserted, skipped }`.

### Updated

**Pages**
- `src/app/onboarding/brand/page.tsx` — converted from static server component to `'use client'`. Pill buttons for category and market now track selection state with gold active style. On Continue: POSTs to `/api/onboarding/brand`, then navigates to competitors step. Validates required fields before enabling the button.
- `src/app/onboarding/competitors/page.tsx` — converted from static mock to `'use client'`. Search input debounced 300ms → `GET /api/onboarding/competitors/search`; results shown inline with Add button. Confirmed list tracks added competitors with Remove option. Manual URL/brand-name paste strips Instagram handle from URL. On Continue: POSTs confirmed list to `/api/onboarding/competitors/save`; skips the API call if none added. Continue button label shows count or "Skip for now".
- `src/app/brief/[brief_id]/page.tsx` — refactored to use shared `<SignalCard>` component; signals query extended with `brands(brand_name)` join for competitor name display.

---

## [0.1.5] 2026-04-14 — Live data connections, Railway deployment, admin CRUD, public brief page

### Added

**Database**
- `supabase/migrations/004_brief_content_columns.sql` — adds `summary text`, `closing_question text`, and `is_baseline boolean` to briefs. Enables web brief rendering without parsing HTML and wires the admin editor's closing-question field to a real column.

**Deployment**
- `apps/workers/railway.toml` — Railway deployment config. Single `NIXPACKS` build definition; each of the 6 services sets `WORKER_NAME` env var to pick its start command. Includes cron schedule reference table (UTC ↔ IST), required env vars per service, and `ON_FAILURE` restart policy.

**API routes**
- `src/app/api/admin/lookup/route.ts` — `GET` (list with optional `?q=` ilike search) + `POST` (create brand_lookup row). Admin cookie required.
- `src/app/api/admin/lookup/[id]/route.ts` — `PUT` (field-allowlist patch) + `DELETE` (204 no content). Admin cookie required.

**Components**
- `src/components/admin/lookup-manager.tsx` — `'use client'` CRUD manager for brand_lookup. Inline add/edit form (2-column grid), alias tag display, client-side search filter, optimistic state updates, `router.refresh()` after mutations.

**Pages**
- `src/app/admin/accounts/page.tsx` — replaced mock data with live Supabase service-role query. Shows plan badge + subscription_status badge, competitor count (non-client brands), trial days remaining (colour-coded), last sent brief with issue number.
- `src/app/admin/lookup/page.tsx` — server component fetches brand_lookup rows and passes to `<LookupManager>`. Was previously a static mock.
- `src/app/brief/[brief_id]/page.tsx` — public brief page now fetches real data via service-role client. Renders headline, summary, signals (with type-coloured left-border cards and implication boxes), and closing question from the new `summary` / `closing_question` columns. Only exposes `status = 'sent'` briefs; returns 404 otherwise.
- `src/app/app/dashboard/page.tsx` — server component with Clerk `auth()`. Queries account by `clerk_user_id`, this week's brief, signal count, competitor brands, current- and prior-week snapshots. Passes typed props to `WeeklyStatusCard` and `CompetitorTable`.

### Updated

**Components**
- `src/components/dashboard/weekly-status-card.tsx` — now accepts `WeeklyStatusCardProps` (briefStatus, briefId, issueNumber, signalCount, sentAt, isFirstBrief, firstBriefDue). Pipeline stage derivation is a pure function of `briefStatus`. Teaser panel varies by state: delivered (link to brief), assembled/pending (signal count + preview link), held (warning box), failed (error box), first brief (expected delivery date).
- `src/components/dashboard/competitor-table.tsx` — now accepts `CompetitorRow[]` prop. Columns: IG followers (lakh/K formatted), last post (relative time, silent ≥14d shown in red), active ads (+N new badge), Amazon ★ (with ↑/↓ delta vs prior week). Empty state links to `/onboarding/competitors`.

**Workers**
- `apps/workers/src/workers/brief-assembler.ts` — upsert now writes `summary`, `closing_question`, and `is_baseline` to the briefs row. `closing_question` is resolved once (with baseline override) before upsert, not inline in the email render calls.
- `apps/workers/src/workers/collector.ts` — instagram `extractMetrics` now captures `follower_count` from `ownerFollowersCount` (present in each post item from `apify/instagram-scraper`). Used by the dashboard competitor table.

### Fixed
- `apps/workers/src/workers/collector.ts` — all `'google_ads'` channel references renamed to `'google_search'` to match the `Channel` union in `types.ts` (ACTOR_SPECS key, PLAN_CHANNELS arrays, handle-skip guard). Was causing typecheck failures.
- `apps/workers/src/workers/ai-interpreter.ts` — Supabase nested select result cast through `unknown` before `SignalRow[]` iteration (two occurrences).
- `apps/workers/src/workers/signal-ranker.ts` — `metrics_current['headlines']` cast through `unknown as unknown[]`; data_points spread casts first element as `Record<string, unknown>` to satisfy TS spread constraint.
- `apps/workers/src/workers/brief-assembler.ts` — removed cross-package import of `unsubscribeUrl` from Next.js app route; now imports from local `../lib/unsubscribe`.

---

## [0.1.4] 2026-04-14 — React Email templates, 6-stage worker pipeline, admin status fixes

### Added

**Database**
- `supabase/migrations/003_worker_tables.sql` — adds `differ_results` staging table (populated by differ, consumed by signal-ranker); adds `score` column to signals; adds `variant_html` and `is_baseline` columns to briefs

**Packages (`apps/emails/`)**
- React Email template package at `apps/emails/` — standalone package exporting three brief variants
- `apps/emails/src/tokens.ts` — shared inline-style design tokens (colors, fonts, SIGNAL_COLORS)
- `apps/emails/src/components/SignalCard.tsx` — reusable signal card (badge, headline, body, implication box, source link)
- `apps/emails/src/BriefFull.tsx` — full variant: header, story section, up to 5 SignalCards, closing question, footer
- `apps/emails/src/BriefChannelFocus.tsx` — channel focus variant: header, channel intro, top 3 SignalCards, footer
- `apps/emails/src/BriefExecutiveDigest.tsx` — executive digest variant: compact signal rows with inline body truncation (no implication boxes)

**Packages (`apps/workers/`)**
- Worker pipeline package at `apps/workers/` — 6-stage Railway cron pipeline
- `apps/workers/src/lib/types.ts` — all DB row interfaces + MetricDelta shape
- `apps/workers/src/lib/supabase.ts` — service-role Supabase client (bypasses RLS)
- `apps/workers/src/lib/logger.ts` — `makeLogger(worker)` JSON logger to stdout/stderr
- `apps/workers/src/lib/unsubscribe.ts` — `unsubscribeUrl()` HMAC helper; mirrors the Next.js app implementation to avoid cross-package import
- `apps/workers/src/workers/collector.ts` — Stage 1 (Sat 11pm IST). Runs Apify actors per channel for each active account/brand. Channels: instagram, meta_ads, amazon, news, google_search. Upserts snapshots, records failed collections.
- `apps/workers/src/workers/differ.ts` — Stage 2 (Sun 1am IST). Loads current and prior-week snapshots in bulk, computes % metric deltas, upserts to differ_results.
- `apps/workers/src/workers/signal-ranker.ts` — Stage 3 (Sun 2am IST). Applies per-channel rule scorers (1–100). Signals below 20 excluded. Writes rule_based signals.
- `apps/workers/src/workers/ai-interpreter.ts` — Stage 4 (Sun 3am IST). Calls Claude claude-sonnet-4-5 with prompt caching. Parses HEADLINE/BODY/IMPLICATION. Flips signal source to 'ai'. Logs fail rate.
- `apps/workers/src/workers/brief-assembler.ts` — Stage 5 (Sun 5am IST). Selects top 5 signals (score ≥ 20). Generates headline/summary/closingQuestion via Claude. Detects baseline brief (no prior 'sent' briefs). Renders per-recipient HTML variants. Upserts brief with status='assembled'.
- `apps/workers/src/workers/delivery.ts` — Stage 6 (Sun 7am IST). Sends per-recipient variant HTML via Resend. Respects skip_next_delivery, trial_brief_sent, is_locked, delivery_paused. RFC 8058 List-Unsubscribe headers. Flips status to 'sent'. Sets trial_brief_sent=true for trial accounts.

### Fixed
- `src/app/admin/briefs/page.tsx` — status names corrected to match DB schema: was using `draft/flagged/approved`, now `pending/assembled/held/sent/failed`. Badge variants updated accordingly. Added `lowConfidence` flag (shown when AI confidence < 0.7).
- `src/app/admin/briefs/[brief_id]/page.tsx` — mock data status `approved` → `assembled`; badge variant mapping corrected.
- `apps/workers/src/workers/collector.ts` — channel key `google_ads` → `google_search` throughout (ACTOR_SPECS key, PLAN_CHANNELS arrays, handle-skip guard); matches the `Channel` union in types.ts.
- `apps/workers/src/workers/ai-interpreter.ts` — Supabase nested select returns complex union type; cast through `unknown` before iterating as `SignalRow[]`.
- `apps/workers/src/workers/signal-ranker.ts` — fixed two TypeScript errors: `metrics_current['headlines']` cast through `unknown` before `unknown[]`; data_points spread casts first element as `Record<string, unknown>`.
- `apps/workers/src/workers/brief-assembler.ts` — replaced cross-package import of `unsubscribeUrl` from `src/app/api/unsubscribe/route` with local `../lib/unsubscribe`.

## [0.1.3] 2026-04-14 — API routes, UpgradeModal, plan limits fix

### Added

**Database**
- `supabase/migrations/002_fix_plan_limits.sql` — corrects plan_limits seed data to match PRD §13 (was wrong in 001); adds `clerk_user_id` to accounts, `trial_brief_sent` flag, `max_channels` column to plan_limits

**Packages**
- `razorpay` ^2.9.6 — Razorpay Node.js SDK for subscription creation
- `stripe` ^22.0.1 — Stripe Node.js SDK for checkout sessions and webhooks
- `svix` ^1.90.0 — Clerk webhook signature verification
- `bcryptjs` ^3.0.3 + `@types/bcryptjs` ^2.4.6 — admin password hashing

**API routes**
- `src/app/api/geo/route.ts` — GET. Detects client country and VPN status via IPQualityScore. Returns `{ country_code, currency, gateway, is_vpn, is_proxy }`. Handles Indian IP + VPN → routes to Stripe/USD (PRD §15 VPN rule). Localhost returns India defaults for local dev.
- `src/app/api/checkout/route.ts` — GET `?plan=starter|growth|agency&annual=true`. Calls `/api/geo` to pick gateway. Razorpay: creates subscription, returns subscription_id + key for frontend modal. Stripe: creates checkout session, redirects. Requires Clerk auth.
- `src/app/api/unsubscribe/route.ts` — GET `?id=<recipient_id>&token=<hmac>`. HMAC-SHA256 token (keyed on RESEND_API_KEY). Sets `recipients.active = false`. Redirects to `/unsubscribed`. Token never expires (PRD: unsubscribe links must always work). Exports `unsubscribeUrl()` helper for email templates.
- `src/app/api/webhooks/razorpay/route.ts` — POST. Verifies HMAC-SHA256 signature. Handles: `subscription.activated`, `subscription.charged`, `subscription.halted`, `subscription.cancelled`, `subscription.pending`. Updates accounts table via service role.
- `src/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts` — POST. Verifies signature via `stripe.webhooks.constructEvent`. Handles: `checkout.session.completed`, `invoice.payment_succeeded`, `invoice.payment_failed`, `customer.subscription.updated`, `customer.subscription.deleted`. Compatible with Stripe v22 Invoice type restructure.
- `src/app/api/webhooks/clerk/route.ts` — POST. Verifies Svix signature. Handles: `user.created` (creates account row + default recipient, sets 14-day trial), `user.deleted` (soft-delete), `organizationMembership.created` (links clerk_org_id).
- `src/app/api/admin/login/route.ts` — POST. bcrypt compares password against ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH. Sets `mayil_admin_session` HttpOnly cookie (8hr, path=/admin).
- `src/app/api/admin/logout/route.ts` — POST. Clears `mayil_admin_session` cookie.

**Components**
- `src/components/ui/dialog.tsx` — Radix Dialog primitive wrapped in Mayil design tokens. Exports Dialog, DialogContent, DialogHeader, DialogFooter, DialogTitle, DialogDescription.
- `src/components/upgrade-modal.tsx` — UpgradeModal client component. Props: `{ open, onClose, reason, currentPlan }`. Shows current vs. next plan limit comparison, pricing, and routes to `/upgrade?reason=`. Wired into recipients settings page.

**Pages**
- `src/app/unsubscribed/page.tsx` — Confirmation page after unsubscribe. No auth required.

### Fixed
- `src/app/admin/login/page.tsx` — converted from server component (HTML form POST → JSON API mismatch) to client component with `fetch('/api/admin/login')` + loading/error states
- `src/proxy.ts` — updated admin cookie check: was looking for `mayil_admin_token` with plaintext password; now checks `mayil_admin_session === 'authenticated'` (set by bcrypt-verified login). Login page now exempted from cookie check.
- `src/lib/utils.ts` — PLAN_LIMITS corrected to match PRD: added `trial` plan, renamed `competitorsPerBrand` → `competitors`, added `channels` field, added `enterprise` plan. Added `UPGRADE_REASONS` map.
- `src/app/app/settings/recipients/page.tsx` — converted to client component; wires UpgradeModal when recipient limit is hit; shows live `used / limit` counter

### Fixed

- `@import` must precede all rules in `globals.css` — moved Google Fonts import to top
- Duplicate `muted` key in `tailwind.config.ts` (TypeScript object literal restriction)
- `autoprefixer` not installed — added as devDependency
- Clerk publishable key missing — created `.env.local` with placeholder values
