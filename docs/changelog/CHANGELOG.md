## [0.1.20] 2026-04-16 — Pending tasks: admin briefs list, OAuth channels, Railway runbook, favicon

### Added

- **OAuth channel connections** (`src/app/api/oauth/[provider]/init/route.ts`, `callback/route.ts`, `disconnect/route.ts`) — full Authorization Code Flow for Meta, Instagram, Google, and LinkedIn. Init route generates a CSRF state token stored in an HttpOnly cookie and redirects to the provider. Callback validates state, exchanges the code for tokens, and stores them in `accounts.oauth_tokens`. Disconnect route removes a provider key. See ADR-011.

- **`src/components/settings/disconnect-button.tsx`** — client component that calls `POST /api/oauth/disconnect` and calls `router.refresh()` on success. Extracted as a client island so the channels page stays a server component.

- **`docs/runbooks/railway-deployment.md`** — step-by-step guide for creating the 7 Railway cron services: service names, `WORKER_NAME` values, UTC cron schedules, required env vars per service, how to verify a manual run, and rollback instructions.

- **`docs/decisions/ADR-011-oauth-channel-connections.md`** — records the decision to use OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow with token storage in `accounts.oauth_tokens` JSONB. Covers CSRF protection, provider config, and V2 improvements needed (refresh token rotation, application-level encryption).

- **`public/favicon.svg`** — restored from git history (gold rounded square with white M, matches brand tokens).

### Changed

- **`src/app/app/settings/channels/page.tsx`** — Connect buttons are now live links to `/api/oauth/[provider]/init` when the provider's env vars are configured (`FACEBOOK_APP_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID`). If env vars are missing, the button remains disabled. Connected channels show a Disconnect button (client island). `searchParams` typed as `Promise<...>` (Next.js 16). Success/error banners shown on redirect back from OAuth.

- **`src/app/admin/briefs/page.tsx`** — replaced mock data (hardcoded Sunfeast/Acme/Demo briefs) with real Supabase fetch. Fetches all briefs across all accounts ordered by `created_at DESC`, bulk-fetches account `company_name`/`email` for display, detects low-confidence signals (any `confidence < 0.70`) with a single `.lt()` query, computes per-tab counts from the result set. `searchParams` typed as `Promise<...>`.

- **`.env.local.example`** — added OAuth provider credentials section with `FACEBOOK_APP_ID/SECRET`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID/SECRET`, `LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID/SECRET` and callback URL instructions.

- **`docs/architecture/api-integrations.md`** — added OAuth Channel Connections section documenting the flow, supported providers, scopes, required env vars, and connect button behaviour.

- **`docs/README.md`** — added ADR-011 and Railway Deployment runbook to their respective index tables.

## [0.1.19] 2026-04-16 — Efficiency & architecture improvements: 7 issues resolved

### Added

- **`src/lib/constants.ts`** — new shared constants file. Exports `BriefStatus` type, `BRIEF_STATUS_VARIANT` (status → Badge variant map), `BRIEF_STATUS_LABEL` (status → display string), and `BRIEF_VARIANT_LABELS` (variant → display string). Eliminates magic strings duplicated across admin and onboarding pages.

- **Error boundaries** — `error.tsx` added to `src/app/app/dashboard/`, `src/app/app/briefs/`, and `src/app/admin/briefs/`. Previously a Supabase failure would crash the whole page with a 500; now shows a user-friendly message with a "Try again" button.

- **Loading skeletons** — `loading.tsx` added to the same three route segments. Users now see an instant skeleton UI instead of a blank page on slow connections.

### Changed

- **`src/lib/utils.ts`** — added `weekRangeLabel(weekStart: string): string` export. The same 7-line function was duplicated verbatim in 5 page files; all five now import from here.

- **`apps/workers/src/workers/delivery.ts`** — eliminated N+1 DB queries in the delivery loop. Previously: 2 queries per brief (1× accounts + 1× recipients) = 2N round-trips. Now: 2 bulk queries (`.in('account_id', accountIds)`) before the loop, then O(1) Map lookups inside. For 50 accounts that's 100 queries → 2.

- **`src/app/brief/[brief_id]/page.tsx`** — replaced `force-dynamic` with `revalidate = 3600`. Sent briefs are immutable; caching them for 1 hour eliminates redundant Supabase reads on every public brief view without any staleness risk.

- **`src/app/api/onboarding/brand/route.ts`** — parallelized the `accounts.update(meta)` + `brands.select(existingBrand)` calls using `Promise.all`. These are independent queries that were previously sequential.

### Refactored

- `src/app/admin/briefs/page.tsx` — imports `BRIEF_STATUS_VARIANT`, `BRIEF_STATUS_LABEL`, `BriefStatus` from `lib/constants` instead of defining them locally.
- `src/app/app/settings/recipients/page.tsx` and `src/app/onboarding/recipients/page.tsx` — import `BRIEF_VARIANT_LABELS` from `lib/constants` instead of defining a local `VARIANT_LABELS` map.
- `src/app/app/dashboard/page.tsx`, `src/app/app/briefs/page.tsx`, `src/app/app/briefs/[brief_id]/page.tsx`, `src/app/brief/[brief_id]/page.tsx`, `src/app/admin/briefs/[brief_id]/page.tsx` — removed local `weekRangeLabel` definitions; import from `lib/utils`.

---

## [0.1.18] 2026-04-15 — Codebase audit: 9 bug fixes across webhooks, brief pages, admin editor

### Fixed

- **`src/app/app/dashboard/page.tsx`** — `.order('suggested_at')` on `competitor_suggestions` changed to `.order('created_at')` (column `suggested_at` does not exist in the schema). Also added `error` destructuring + `console.error` logging on all six previously-silent DB queries (briefs, signal count, sent brief count, brands, snapshots, prev snapshots) so failures surface in Vercel logs.

- **Webhook routes — legacy Supabase SDK removed** (`src/app/api/webhooks/clerk/route.ts`, `razorpay/route.ts`, `stripe/route.ts`, `src/app/api/unsubscribe/route.ts`) — all four files were importing `createClient` from `@supabase/supabase-js` directly and wrapping it in a local `serviceSupabase()` helper, violating the `@supabase/ssr` hard rule in CLAUDE.md. Replaced with `import { createServiceClient } from '@/lib/supabase/server'` in every file.

- **`.env.local.example`** — `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL` was `/onboarding` (would 404); corrected to `/onboarding/brand`.

- **Admin brief editor** (`src/app/admin/briefs/[brief_id]/page.tsx`) — was entirely hardcoded mock data (Sunfeast/ITC example). Rewritten as an async server component: fetches brief by `brief_id` via `createServiceClient()`, fetches the account `company_name`, fetches signals by `brief.signal_ids` with a brand-name join, computes `weekRangeLabel` from `brief.week_start`. Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` and `notFound()` for missing briefs. `params` typed as `Promise<{ brief_id: string }>` (Next.js 16 App Router convention).

- **`sources` JSONB normalization** (`src/app/app/briefs/[brief_id]/page.tsx`, `src/app/brief/[brief_id]/page.tsx`) — both pages cast `s.sources` directly to `string[]`, which breaks when the worker writes `{url, title}[]` objects. Added `normalizeSources(raw: unknown): string[]` helper to `src/lib/utils.ts` that handles both shapes. Both brief pages now call `normalizeSources(s.sources)` instead. Also fixed `.order('score', ...)` → `.order('confidence', ...)` in both files (`score` is not a column; `confidence` is). Updated `params` to `Promise<...>` in both files.

- **`src/components/upgrade/plan-cards.tsx`** — removed stale `// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` comment on the `Window.Razorpay` declaration; the type already uses `Record<string, unknown>`, not `any`.

### Added

- **`src/lib/types.ts`** — new shared types file with `DbBrand` and `DbRecipient` interfaces. `src/app/app/settings/competitors/page.tsx` and `src/app/app/settings/recipients/page.tsx` now import from here instead of defining identical interfaces locally.

---

## [0.1.17] 2026-04-15 — Enforce documentation: Stop hook + git pre-commit guard

### Added

- **`.claude/hooks/stop.js`** — `Stop` hook that fires when Claude finishes responding. Checks `git diff --name-only HEAD` for uncommitted source files. If source files changed but `CHANGELOG.md` was not touched, it **writes a `[DRAFT]` skeleton entry directly into `CHANGELOG.md`** — no Claude cooperation required. The draft lists every changed file; Claude or the user replaces it with a proper description. A `systemMessage` is shown so Claude sees what was written.

- **`.claude/hooks/pre-compact.js`** — `PreCompact` hook (both `auto` and `manual`) that fires just before context is compacted. Injects `additionalContext` listing changed source files and whether CHANGELOG was updated. Last-chance reminder before the session context is squashed.

- **`scripts/hooks/pre-commit`** — Git `pre-commit` hook script. Blocks `git commit` if `.ts`/`.tsx`/`.sql`/`.css` files are staged but `docs/changelog/CHANGELOG.md` is not. Completely independent of Claude Code — enforces at commit time regardless of how the commit is made. Bypass with `--no-verify` in emergencies.

- **`scripts/hooks/install.js`** — One-time installer: copies `scripts/hooks/pre-commit` → `.git/hooks/pre-commit`, backs up any existing hook, sets executable permissions.

### Why

The previous `PostToolUse` reminder approach (`auto-doc.js`) only injects `additionalContext` — text Claude reads but isn't forced to act on. If Claude defers the reminder to finish a task and compaction fires first, the context is lost with no documentation written.

The new three-layer enforcement:

| Layer | When | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `PostToolUse` (existing) | After every file write | Soft reminder with relevant arch docs |
| `Stop` hook (new) | When Claude stops | **Writes draft to CHANGELOG.md automatically** |
| `PreCompact` hook (new) | Before context squash | Strong reminder with changed file list |
| `pre-commit` git hook (new) | On `git commit` | **Blocks commit** if CHANGELOG not staged |

The `Stop` hook and `pre-commit` hook do not rely on Claude — they enforce the requirement mechanically.

## [0.1.16] 2026-04-15 — Platform picker for onboarding + Settings → Brands & competitors

### Changed

- **Onboarding → Brand** (`src/app/onboarding/brand/page.tsx`) — replaced four flat channel-handle fields (Instagram, YouTube, LinkedIn, Facebook) with a platform picker. Platforms display as selectable pills; defaults are auto-selected based on the chosen business type (B2C → Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, Amazon; B2B → YouTube, LinkedIn; Global → Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube). User can toggle any platform on/off. Handle inputs appear only for selected platforms. Uses `src/lib/platforms.ts` for all platform logic.
- **Onboarding → Competitors** (`src/app/onboarding/competitors/page.tsx`) — removed the brand search bar (DB/LLM lookup is not yet wired up; showing an empty search would be confusing). The "Add competitor" form is now always open and is the primary interface. Each competitor gets a platform picker + per-platform handle fields. Form resets after add but stays open so multiple competitors can be added without extra clicks.

### Added

- **Settings → Brands & competitors** (`src/app/app/settings/competitors/page.tsx`) — new settings page. Shows the client brand and all competitor brands, each with a "Edit channels" inline form (platform picker + handle inputs). Competitors can be removed. New competitors can be added via an "+ Add competitor" form at the top.
- `src/app/api/settings/brands/route.ts` — `GET /api/settings/brands`: returns all brands (client + competitors) for the account.
- `src/app/api/settings/brands/[brand_id]/route.ts` — `PATCH /api/settings/brands/:id`: updates `brands.channels` from `{ selectedPlatforms, handles }` using `buildChannels()`. `DELETE /api/settings/brands/:id`: removes a competitor brand; client brands (`is_client=true`) are protected.
- **Settings nav** (`src/app/app/settings/layout.tsx`) — added "Brands & competitors" between Team and Connected channels.

### Why

Users had no way to edit channel handles or add/remove competitors after onboarding. The flat-field approach also didn't communicate which platforms are relevant for B2C vs B2B brands. The platform picker solves both: it guides users to the right defaults and is reused consistently across onboarding and settings.

## [0.1.15] 2026-04-15 — Security: enable RLS on differ_results, ninjapear_cache, competitor_suggestions

### Fixed

- `supabase/migrations/008_rls_missing_tables.sql` — Supabase security linter flagged three public tables with RLS disabled:
  - **`differ_results`** — worker-only staging table. RLS enabled + `differ_results_isolation` policy (`account_id::text = auth.uid()::text`). Railway workers use `SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` which bypasses RLS; policy is defence-in-depth.
  - **`ninjapear_cache`** — shared cache with no `account_id` column. RLS enabled with **no permissive policy**, so only service-role access is possible. Anon/authenticated user clients are fully blocked from this table.
  - **`competitor_suggestions`** — per-account table read by the dashboard. RLS enabled + `suggestions_isolation` policy (same isolation pattern as all other tenant tables).

These were missed in migrations 003 and 006. All other tables were created with RLS from migration 001.

---

## [0.1.14] 2026-04-15 — Fix account-not-found 404; market/country overhaul

### Fixed

- **Account not found (404)** — `POST /api/onboarding/brand` returned 404 when no `accounts` row existed. Root cause: Clerk webhook not yet configured in Clerk Dashboard, so `user.created` events never reached `/api/webhooks/clerk`. Fix: lazy account creation — if no row exists, the route fetches the Clerk user via `currentUser()`, inserts the account (trial plan, 14-day trial), and adds the owner as a default recipient before continuing. The webhook path remains primary; this is a safe fallback.

### Changed

- **Business type** (`accounts.market`) — options changed from `India B2C / India B2B / International` to `B2C / B2B / Global`. The label is now "Business type" (not "Market"). B2C/B2B determines which channel types are relevant; country is now a separate field.
- **Country of business** (`accounts.country`, new column via migration 007) — ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code (`IN`, `US`, etc.). Auto-detected from the caller's IP using Vercel's built-in `x-vercel-ip-country` request header (no external API, no cost). User can change it via a dropdown of 21 countries + "Other". Country is saved alongside business type on the brand step.

### Added

- `supabase/migrations/007_account_country.sql` — `ALTER TABLE accounts ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS country text`
- `src/app/api/geo/country/route.ts` — `GET /api/geo/country` reads `x-vercel-ip-country` header and returns `{ code, name }`. Used by the onboarding brand page on mount.

---

## [0.1.13] 2026-04-15 — Channel handles in onboarding (brand + competitors)

### Added

- **Onboarding → Brand** (`src/app/onboarding/brand/page.tsx`) — new "Channel handles" section with four optional fields: Instagram, YouTube, LinkedIn company, Facebook page. Accepts raw handles (`@brand`) or full profile URLs — both are normalised to a plain handle before saving. Data flows into `brands.channels` JSONB so the collector worker can start tracking immediately.
- **`/api/onboarding/brand`** (`src/app/api/onboarding/brand/route.ts`) — now accepts and saves a `channels` object from the form body. Works for both initial insert and re-submit (update).
- **Onboarding → Competitors** (`src/app/onboarding/competitors/page.tsx`) — "Add manually" form expanded from a single URL field to a structured form: brand name (required) + Instagram / YouTube / LinkedIn fields. Handles are normalised from URLs the same way as the brand step.
- **`/api/onboarding/competitors/save`** (`src/app/api/onboarding/competitors/save\route.ts`) — accepts optional `channels` per competitor; merges with legacy `instagram` / `amazon_brand` fields so both paths still work.

### Why

Without these fields, brands without a known website produced empty `channels: {}` — meaning the collector worker had no handles to scrape and would silently produce no snapshots for that brand.

---

## [0.1.12] 2026-04-15 — Design system fixes: colours, font size, favicon

### Fixed

- **CSS variables** (`src/app/globals.css`) — shadcn/ui bridge variables were set with RGB component values (e.g. `240 237 228`) where proper HSL notation (`H S% L%`) is required. `hsl(var(--muted))` with raw RGB digits produces an out-of-range or wrong colour in all browsers. All 11 variables converted to correct HSL values.
- **`text-muted` colour** (`tailwind.config.ts`) — `muted` Tailwind token was an object pointing to `hsl(var(--muted))` (the surface-2 background). It is now a flat hex string `#6B6860`, so `text-muted` always renders the intended secondary-text grey regardless of the CSS variable layer. Removed the shadcn `muted` object entry (Button and Badge components use direct Mayil tokens, not shadcn muted classes).
- **Base font size** (`src/app/globals.css`) — `html/body font-size` raised from `14px` to `16px` (browser default) so Tailwind's relative `text-sm` / `text-base` units render at expected sizes.
- **Favicon** (`public/favicon.svg`) — Background was `#F7F4ED` (paper) which is indistinguishable from light browser tab chrome. Replaced with gold (`#B8922A`) background and white "M" mark.

---

## [0.1.11] 2026-04-15 — NinjaPear competitor enrichment (background, cached)

### Added

**Database**
- `supabase/migrations/006_ninjapear_cache.sql` — adds `ninjapear_cache` table (website-keyed, 30-day TTL, shared across accounts), `competitor_suggestions` table (per-account suggestions with pending/accepted/dismissed status), and `accounts.ninjapear_enrichment_status` column.

**Workers**
- `apps/workers/src/workers/enrichment.ts` — new Railway cron worker (daily 8am IST). Picks up accounts with `ninjapear_enrichment_status = 'pending'`, checks `ninjapear_cache` before calling NinjaPear `/competitor/listing`, stores new competitors as `competitor_suggestions`, marks account `done`. Skips brands already tracked. Gracefully handles API timeout (100s) and missing key.

**API routes**
- `src/app/api/suggestions/[id]/route.ts` — `PATCH { action: 'accept' | 'dismiss' }`. Accept: inserts competitor brand row from suggestion + marks accepted. Dismiss: marks dismissed only. Ownership-checked via `account_id`.

**Components**
- `src/components/dashboard/competitor-suggestions.tsx` — `'use client'` card shown on dashboard when pending suggestions exist. Add / Dismiss per item, Add all button. Removes item from list optimistically after action.

### Updated

- `src/app/app/dashboard/page.tsx` — queries `competitor_suggestions` for the account and renders `<CompetitorSuggestions>` above the competitor table when suggestions are pending.
- `src/app/api/onboarding/complete/route.ts` — sets `ninjapear_enrichment_status = 'pending'` alongside `onboarding_completed_at`, triggering the enrichment worker on its next daily run.
- `apps/workers/package.json` — added `"enrichment": "tsx src/workers/enrichment.ts"` script.
- `apps/workers/railway.toml` — added enrichment service entry (cron `30 2 * * *` UTC = 8am IST daily, requires `NINJAPEAR_API_KEY`).
- `.env.local.example` — added `NINJAPEAR_API_KEY`.

### Cache strategy

NinjaPear competitor listing costs ~74 credits and takes ~82 seconds per company. Results are cached in `ninjapear_cache` for 30 days keyed by website URL, shared across all accounts that track the same competitor. After the initial call, subsequent accounts with the same competitor domain pay 0 credits and get instant results.

## [0.1.10] 2026-04-15 — Force dynamic rendering on all data-fetching pages

### Fixed

Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to all 9 server component pages that query Supabase or Clerk at request time. Without this, Next.js attempts to prerender them at build time — failing because env vars (Supabase URL/key, Clerk key) are runtime secrets not available during the Vercel build phase.

Pages fixed: `admin/accounts`, `admin/lookup`, `app/briefs`, `app/briefs/[brief_id]`, `app/dashboard`, `app/settings/channels`, `app/settings/subscription`, `app/settings/team`, `brief/[brief_id]`.

---

## [0.1.9] 2026-04-14 — Build fixes (TypeScript + Turbopack errors)

### Fixed

- `src/app/api/settings/team/route.ts` — operator precedence error: `|| ... ??` mix requires parens around the `||` operand before applying `??`.
- `src/app/app/settings/team/page.tsx` — same operator precedence fix (identical pattern).
- `src/app/api/settings/subscription/route.ts` — Supabase `GenericStringError` type not directly castable to account shape; cast through `unknown` first.
- `src/app/app/settings/subscription/page.tsx` — same `as unknown as` cast fix.
- `src/app/app/briefs/page.tsx` — `brief.sent_at` typed `unknown` (from `Record<string, unknown>` row); changed `&&` short-circuit to ternary `? ... : null` so TypeScript accepts it as `ReactNode`.

---

## [0.1.8] 2026-04-14 — Single-domain deployment (emayil.com)

### Changed

- Deployment URL consolidated to `emayil.com` (was `app.emayil.com`). The subdomain added complexity with no user-facing benefit since the landing page and app are a single Next.js deployment.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` default fallback updated in `src/app/layout.tsx`, `src/app/brief/[brief_id]/page.tsx`, and `apps/workers/src/workers/brief-assembler.ts`.
- `.env.local.example` updated to reflect `https://emayil.com`.
- All documentation updated: `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/README.md`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/architecture/overview.md`.

### Action required on deploy

- Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://emayil.com` in Vercel environment variables.
- Update Clerk Dashboard redirect URLs from `app.emayil.com/*` to `emayil.com/*`.
- Update Razorpay, Stripe, and Clerk webhook URLs to `emayil.com/api/webhooks/*`.

---

## [0.1.7] 2026-04-14 — Settings pages wired, onboarding complete, upgrade checkout, team management

### Added

**Database**
- `supabase/migrations/005_account_profile_fields.sql` — adds `company_name text` and `role text` to accounts table; used by the settings profile page.

**API routes**
- `src/app/api/settings/profile/route.ts` — `GET` (Clerk display name + account fields) + `PATCH` (updates `company_name`, `role`, `whatsapp_number` on accounts).
- `src/app/api/settings/recipients/route.ts` — `GET` (list active recipients + plan limit) + `POST` (create, enforces plan limit, returns 403 with `upgrade: true` when at limit).
- `src/app/api/settings/recipients/[id]/route.ts` — `DELETE` (soft-delete via `active = false`, ownership-checked).
- `src/app/api/settings/delivery/route.ts` — `GET` (delivery state + computed next Sunday IST label) + `POST` (`action: skip | pause | resume` toggles `skip_next_delivery` / `delivery_paused` on accounts).
- `src/app/api/settings/subscription/route.ts` — `GET` returns plan, subscription_status, billing_currency, trial_ends_at, gateway, and live usage counts (brands / competitors / recipients) from Supabase.
- `src/app/api/settings/team/route.ts` — `GET` returns Clerk org members (falls back to owner-only when no org); `POST` sends a Clerk org invitation, creating the org first if `clerk_org_id` is null on the account.
- `src/app/api/onboarding/complete/route.ts` — `POST` stamps `onboarding_completed_at` on the account (no-op if already set).

**Components**
- `src/components/settings/team-invite-form.tsx` — `'use client'` invite card; shows seat-limit upgrade prompt when at cap, otherwise POSTs to `/api/settings/team` and shows inline success/error state.
- `src/components/upgrade/plan-cards.tsx` — `'use client'` card grid handling both gateway flows: Stripe (JSON `url` → `window.location.href`) and Razorpay (opens checkout modal via dynamically loaded `razorpay.js`).

### Updated

**Pages — Onboarding**
- `src/app/onboarding/recipients/page.tsx` — converted to `'use client'`; add form POSTs to `/api/settings/recipients`; added list shows confirmed recipients; Continue skips the API call if none added.
- `src/app/onboarding/done/page.tsx` — converted to `'use client'`; fires `POST /api/onboarding/complete` on mount via `useEffect`.

**Pages — Settings**
- `src/app/app/settings/profile/page.tsx` — `'use client'`; loads from `GET /api/settings/profile` on mount; name/email are read-only (Clerk-managed); company, role, and phone save via `PATCH`; inline "Saved" confirmation.
- `src/app/app/settings/delivery/page.tsx` — `'use client'`; loads delivery state from `GET /api/settings/delivery`; Skip / Pause / Resume buttons call `POST /api/settings/delivery`; state updates optimistically.
- `src/app/app/settings/recipients/page.tsx` — replaced MOCK data with `GET /api/settings/recipients`; add form and Remove buttons call the new routes; upgrade modal fires when at plan limit.
- `src/app/app/settings/subscription/page.tsx` — server component; reads plan + usage counts directly from Supabase; usage bars colour-coded (gold / watch / threat); billing history section shows gateway-specific contact note or trial message.
- `src/app/app/settings/team/page.tsx` — server component; reads Clerk org members via `clerkClient()` (falls back to owner); passes seat limit + current count to `<TeamInviteForm>`.
- `src/app/app/settings/channels/page.tsx` — server component; reads `accounts.oauth_tokens` to derive real connected / disconnected / auto status per channel; Connect buttons disabled with note pending OAuth rollout; plan-tier locking driven by `PLAN_LIMITS`.
- `src/app/upgrade/page.tsx` — refactored to server component (reads `searchParams`, avoids `useSearchParams` SSR issue); delegates rendering to `<UpgradePlanCards>`.

**API**
- `src/app/api/checkout/route.ts` — Stripe flow now returns `{ gateway: 'stripe', url }` JSON instead of `NextResponse.redirect()`; consistent with Razorpay response shape so the client can handle both uniformly.

---

## [0.1.6] 2026-04-14 — App briefs pages, onboarding wired to API, signal card shared component

### Added

**Components**
- `src/components/brief/signal-card.tsx` — shared `<SignalCard>` component and `SignalCardData` interface. Type-coloured left-border card with signal type badge, channel label, headline, body, optional implication box, and source links. Used by both public `/brief/[id]` and authenticated `/app/briefs/[id]`.

**Pages**
- `src/app/app/briefs/page.tsx` — authenticated briefs list. Fetches all briefs for the account in reverse issue order; batches all signal IDs into one query to get signal types; renders signal-type dot indicators, held/preview-ready badges, read/unread badge, and delivery date.
- `src/app/app/briefs/[brief_id]/page.tsx` — authenticated brief detail. Verifies account ownership; shows preview banner for `assembled` status, held/failed warning banners; share button only visible when `status = 'sent'`; renders signals via `<SignalCard>`.

**API routes**
- `src/app/api/onboarding/brand/route.ts` — `POST` saves (or updates) the client brand and sets `accounts.category` + `accounts.market`. Maps UI category labels to DB values; upserts the single `is_client = true` brand row.
- `src/app/api/onboarding/competitors/search/route.ts` — `GET ?q=` fuzzy brand search. Short queries use ilike; longer queries call `find_similar_brand` Postgres RPC (threshold 0.25); falls back to ilike if RPC is unavailable.
- `src/app/api/onboarding/competitors/save/route.ts` — `POST { competitors }` inserts confirmed competitor brands, skipping duplicates by name. Stores `channels.instagram.handle` and `channels.amazon.brand_name` from lookup data. Returns `{ inserted, skipped }`.

### Updated

**Pages**
- `src/app/onboarding/brand/page.tsx` — converted from static server component to `'use client'`. Pill buttons for category and market now track selection state with gold active style. On Continue: POSTs to `/api/onboarding/brand`, then navigates to competitors step. Validates required fields before enabling the button.
- `src/app/onboarding/competitors/page.tsx` — converted from static mock to `'use client'`. Search input debounced 300ms → `GET /api/onboarding/competitors/search`; results shown inline with Add button. Confirmed list tracks added competitors with Remove option. Manual URL/brand-name paste strips Instagram handle from URL. On Continue: POSTs confirmed list to `/api/onboarding/competitors/save`; skips the API call if none added. Continue button label shows count or "Skip for now".
- `src/app/brief/[brief_id]/page.tsx` — refactored to use shared `<SignalCard>` component; signals query extended with `brands(brand_name)` join for competitor name display.

## [0.1.5] 2026-04-14 — Live data connections, Railway deployment, admin CRUD, public brief page

### Added

**Database**
- `supabase/migrations/004_brief_content_columns.sql` — adds `summary text`, `closing_question text`, and `is_baseline boolean` to briefs. Enables web brief rendering without parsing HTML and wires the admin editor's closing-question field to a real column.

**Deployment**
- `apps/workers/railway.toml` — Railway deployment config. Single `NIXPACKS` build definition; each of the 6 services sets `WORKER_NAME` env var to pick its start command. Includes cron schedule reference table (UTC ↔ IST), required env vars per service, and `ON_FAILURE` restart policy.

**API routes**
- `src/app/api/admin/lookup/route.ts` — `GET` (list with optional `?q=` ilike search) + `POST` (create brand_lookup row). Admin cookie required.
- `src/app/api/admin/lookup/[id]/route.ts` — `PUT` (field-allowlist patch) + `DELETE` (204 no content). Admin cookie required.

**Components**
- `src/components/admin/lookup-manager.tsx` — `'use client'` CRUD manager for brand_lookup. Inline add/edit form (2-column grid), alias tag display, client-side search filter, optimistic state updates, `router.refresh()` after mutations.

**Pages**
- `src/app/admin/accounts/page.tsx` — replaced mock data with live Supabase service-role query. Shows plan badge + subscription_status badge, competitor count (non-client brands), trial days remaining (colour-coded), last sent brief with issue number.
- `src/app/admin/lookup/page.tsx` — server component fetches brand_lookup rows and passes to `<LookupManager>`. Was previously a static mock.
- `src/app/brief/[brief_id]/page.tsx` — public brief page now fetches real data via service-role client. Renders headline, summary, signals (with type-coloured left-border cards and implication boxes), and closing question from the new `summary` / `closing_question` columns. Only exposes `status = 'sent'` briefs; returns 404 otherwise.
- `src/app/app/dashboard/page.tsx` — server component with Clerk `auth()`. Queries account by `clerk_user_id`, this week's brief, signal count, competitor brands, current- and prior-week snapshots. Passes typed props to `WeeklyStatusCard` and `CompetitorTable`.

### Updated

**Components**
- `src/components/dashboard/weekly-status-card.tsx` — now accepts `WeeklyStatusCardProps` (briefStatus, briefId, issueNumber, signalCount, sentAt, isFirstBrief, firstBriefDue). Pipeline stage derivation is a pure function of `briefStatus`. Teaser panel varies by state: delivered (link to brief), assembled/pending (signal count + preview link), held (warning box), failed (error box), first brief (expected delivery date).
- `src/components/dashboard/competitor-table.tsx` — now accepts `CompetitorRow[]` prop. Columns: IG followers (lakh/K formatted), last post (relative time, silent ≥14d shown in red), active ads (+N new badge), Amazon ★ (with ↑/↓ delta vs prior week). Empty state links to `/onboarding/competitors`.

**Workers**
- `apps/workers/src/workers/brief-assembler.ts` — upsert now writes `summary`, `closing_question`, and `is_baseline` to the briefs row. `closing_question` is resolved once (with baseline override) before upsert, not inline in the email render calls.
- `apps/workers/src/workers/collector.ts` — instagram `extractMetrics` now captures `follower_count` from `ownerFollowersCount` (present in each post item from `apify/instagram-scraper`). Used by the dashboard competitor table.

### Fixed
- `apps/workers/src/workers/collector.ts` — all `'google_ads'` channel references renamed to `'google_search'` to match the `Channel` union in `types.ts` (ACTOR_SPECS key, PLAN_CHANNELS arrays, handle-skip guard). Was causing typecheck failures.
- `apps/workers/src/workers/ai-interpreter.ts` — Supabase nested select result cast through `unknown` before `SignalRow[]` iteration (two occurrences).
- `apps/workers/src/workers/signal-ranker.ts` — `metrics_current['headlines']` cast through `unknown as unknown[]`; data_points spread casts first element as `Record<string, unknown>` to satisfy TS spread constraint.
- `apps/workers/src/workers/brief-assembler.ts` — removed cross-package import of `unsubscribeUrl` from Next.js app route; now imports from local `../lib/unsubscribe`.

---

## [0.1.4] 2026-04-14 — React Email templates, 6-stage worker pipeline, admin status fixes

### Added

**Database**
- `supabase/migrations/003_worker_tables.sql` — adds `differ_results` staging table (populated by differ, consumed by signal-ranker); adds `score` column to signals; adds `variant_html` and `is_baseline` columns to briefs

**Packages (`apps/emails/`)**
- React Email template package at `apps/emails/` — standalone package exporting three brief variants
- `apps/emails/src/tokens.ts` — shared inline-style design tokens (colors, fonts, SIGNAL_COLORS)
- `apps/emails/src/components/SignalCard.tsx` — reusable signal card (badge, headline, body, implication box, source link)
- `apps/emails/src/BriefFull.tsx` — full variant: header, story section, up to 5 SignalCards, closing question, footer
- `apps/emails/src/BriefChannelFocus.tsx` — channel focus variant: header, channel intro, top 3 SignalCards, footer
- `apps/emails/src/BriefExecutiveDigest.tsx` — executive digest variant: compact signal rows with inline body truncation (no implication boxes)

**Packages (`apps/workers/`)**
- Worker pipeline package at `apps/workers/` — 6-stage Railway cron pipeline
- `apps/workers/src/lib/types.ts` — all DB row interfaces + MetricDelta shape
- `apps/workers/src/lib/supabase.ts` — service-role Supabase client (bypasses RLS)
- `apps/workers/src/lib/logger.ts` — `makeLogger(worker)` JSON logger to stdout/stderr
- `apps/workers/src/lib/unsubscribe.ts` — `unsubscribeUrl()` HMAC helper; mirrors the Next.js app implementation to avoid cross-package import
- `apps/workers/src/workers/collector.ts` — Stage 1 (Sat 11pm IST). Runs Apify actors per channel for each active account/brand. Channels: instagram, meta_ads, amazon, news, google_search. Upserts snapshots, records failed collections.
- `apps/workers/src/workers/differ.ts` — Stage 2 (Sun 1am IST). Loads current and prior-week snapshots in bulk, computes % metric deltas, upserts to differ_results.
- `apps/workers/src/workers/signal-ranker.ts` — Stage 3 (Sun 2am IST). Applies per-channel rule scorers (1–100). Signals below 20 excluded. Writes rule_based signals.
- `apps/workers/src/workers/ai-interpreter.ts` — Stage 4 (Sun 3am IST). Calls Claude claude-sonnet-4-5 with prompt caching. Parses HEADLINE/BODY/IMPLICATION. Flips signal source to 'ai'. Logs fail rate.
- `apps/workers/src/workers/brief-assembler.ts` — Stage 5 (Sun 5am IST). Selects top 5 signals (score ≥ 20). Generates headline/summary/closingQuestion via Claude. Detects baseline brief (no prior 'sent' briefs). Renders per-recipient HTML variants. Upserts brief with status='assembled'.
- `apps/workers/src/workers/delivery.ts` — Stage 6 (Sun 7am IST). Sends per-recipient variant HTML via Resend. Respects skip_next_delivery, trial_brief_sent, is_locked, delivery_paused. RFC 8058 List-Unsubscribe headers. Flips status to 'sent'. Sets trial_brief_sent=true for trial accounts.

### Fixed
- `src/app/admin/briefs/page.tsx` — status names corrected to match DB schema: was using `draft/flagged/approved`, now `pending/assembled/held/sent/failed`. Badge variants updated accordingly. Added `lowConfidence` flag (shown when AI confidence < 0.7).
- `src/app/admin/briefs/[brief_id]/page.tsx` — mock data status `approved` → `assembled`; badge variant mapping corrected.
- `apps/workers/src/workers/collector.ts` — channel key `google_ads` → `google_search` throughout (ACTOR_SPECS key, PLAN_CHANNELS arrays, handle-skip guard); matches the `Channel` union in types.ts.
- `apps/workers/src/workers/ai-interpreter.ts` — Supabase nested select returns complex union type; cast through `unknown` before iterating as `SignalRow[]`.
- `apps/workers/src/workers/signal-ranker.ts` — fixed two TypeScript errors: `metrics_current['headlines']` cast through `unknown` before `unknown[]`; data_points spread casts first element as `Record<string, unknown>`.
- `apps/workers/src/workers/brief-assembler.ts` — replaced cross-package import of `unsubscribeUrl` from `src/app/api/unsubscribe/route` with local `../lib/unsubscribe`.

## [0.1.3] 2026-04-14 — API routes, UpgradeModal, plan limits fix

### Added

**Database**
- `supabase/migrations/002_fix_plan_limits.sql` — corrects plan_limits seed data to match PRD §13 (was wrong in 001); adds `clerk_user_id` to accounts, `trial_brief_sent` flag, `max_channels` column to plan_limits

**Packages**
- `razorpay` ^2.9.6 — Razorpay Node.js SDK for subscription creation
- `stripe` ^22.0.1 — Stripe Node.js SDK for checkout sessions and webhooks
- `svix` ^1.90.0 — Clerk webhook signature verification
- `bcryptjs` ^3.0.3 + `@types/bcryptjs` ^2.4.6 — admin password hashing

**API routes**
- `src/app/api/geo/route.ts` — GET. Detects client country and VPN status via IPQualityScore. Returns `{ country_code, currency, gateway, is_vpn, is_proxy }`. Handles Indian IP + VPN → routes to Stripe/USD (PRD §15 VPN rule). Localhost returns India defaults for local dev.
- `src/app/api/checkout/route.ts` — GET `?plan=starter|growth|agency&annual=true`. Calls `/api/geo` to pick gateway. Razorpay: creates subscription, returns subscription_id + key for frontend modal. Stripe: creates checkout session, redirects. Requires Clerk auth.
- `src/app/api/unsubscribe/route.ts` — GET `?id=<recipient_id>&token=<hmac>`. HMAC-SHA256 token (keyed on RESEND_API_KEY). Sets `recipients.active = false`. Redirects to `/unsubscribed`. Token never expires (PRD: unsubscribe links must always work). Exports `unsubscribeUrl()` helper for email templates.
- `src/app/api/webhooks/razorpay/route.ts` — POST. Verifies HMAC-SHA256 signature. Handles: `subscription.activated`, `subscription.charged`, `subscription.halted`, `subscription.cancelled`, `subscription.pending`. Updates accounts table via service role.
- `src/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts` — POST. Verifies signature via `stripe.webhooks.constructEvent`. Handles: `checkout.session.completed`, `invoice.payment_succeeded`, `invoice.payment_failed`, `customer.subscription.updated`, `customer.subscription.deleted`. Compatible with Stripe v22 Invoice type restructure.
- `src/app/api/webhooks/clerk/route.ts` — POST. Verifies Svix signature. Handles: `user.created` (creates account row + default recipient, sets 14-day trial), `user.deleted` (soft-delete), `organizationMembership.created` (links clerk_org_id).
- `src/app/api/admin/login/route.ts` — POST. bcrypt compares password against ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH. Sets `mayil_admin_session` HttpOnly cookie (8hr, path=/admin).
- `src/app/api/admin/logout/route.ts` — POST. Clears `mayil_admin_session` cookie.

**Components**
- `src/components/ui/dialog.tsx` — Radix Dialog primitive wrapped in Mayil design tokens. Exports Dialog, DialogContent, DialogHeader, DialogFooter, DialogTitle, DialogDescription.
- `src/components/upgrade-modal.tsx` — UpgradeModal client component. Props: `{ open, onClose, reason, currentPlan }`. Shows current vs. next plan limit comparison, pricing, and routes to `/upgrade?reason=`. Wired into recipients settings page.

**Pages**
- `src/app/unsubscribed/page.tsx` — Confirmation page after unsubscribe. No auth required.

### Fixed
- `src/app/admin/login/page.tsx` — converted from server component (HTML form POST → JSON API mismatch) to client component with `fetch('/api/admin/login')` + loading/error states
- `src/proxy.ts` — updated admin cookie check: was looking for `mayil_admin_token` with plaintext password; now checks `mayil_admin_session === 'authenticated'` (set by bcrypt-verified login). Login page now exempted from cookie check.
- `src/lib/utils.ts` — PLAN_LIMITS corrected to match PRD: added `trial` plan, renamed `competitorsPerBrand` → `competitors`, added `channels` field, added `enterprise` plan. Added `UPGRADE_REASONS` map.
- `src/app/app/settings/recipients/page.tsx` — converted to client component; wires UpgradeModal when recipient limit is hit; shows live `used / limit` counter

### Environment variables added (document in .env.local)
```
CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET          # Svix secret from Clerk dashboard webhook settings
